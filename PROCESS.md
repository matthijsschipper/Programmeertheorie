| Birgit | 10:00 | 13:00 | Worked with Matthijs to adjust the datastructure to the algorithm. |
| Jade | 11:00 | 15:00 | Suggested improvements to the new datastructure and started working on new algorithm.|

| Matthijs | 07:00 | 15:00 | First I dived into the new datastructure and tried to get a grasp of how it works in detail, together with the random algorithm. I then found out that the algorithm was not working properly and debugged it for a few hours. In the two hours before the lecture, I worked on the baseline document together with Birgit. |
| Birgit | 13:00 | 15:00 | Added a feature to the visualisation, worked in the baseline document. |
