| Name | Start-time | End-time | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Matthijs | 11:00 | 15:00 | Cleared up the old version of the Grid and Route class and added comments. |
| Jade | 11:00 | 15:00 | Cleared up the old version of the Grid and Route class (together with Matthijs), worked on Output function, updated UML diagram. |
| Birgit | 20:45 | 23:15 | Merched datastructures by hand, hope everything works but tbh I'm exhausted. I'll check for bugs first thing in the morning. |

| Jade | 01:00 | 03:00 | Suggested improvements to the new datastructure.|
| Matthijs | 06:15 | 11:00 | Developed a random algorithm and worked together with Birgit on finetuning this algorithm and adjusting it to the datastructure |
| Birgit | 10:00 | 13:00 | Worked with Matthijs to adjust the datastructure to the algorithm. |
| Jade | 13:00 | 16:00 | Started working on A* algorithm.|
| Birgit | 14:00 | 17:15 | Continuing fixing bugs in the datastructure. |
| Matthijs | 14:00 | 16:30 | Worked with Birgit on fixing bugs in the datastructure and the random algorithm |
| Jade | 22:00 | 23:59 | Worked on A* algorithm.|

| Jade | 00:00 | 04:00 | Worked on A* algorithm.|
| Matthijs | 07:00 | 15:00 | First I dived into the new datastructure and tried to get a grasp of how it works in detail, together with the random algorithm. I then found out that the algorithm was not working properly and debugged it for a few hours. In the two hours before the lecture, I worked on the baseline document together with Birgit. |
| Birgit | 13:00 | 15:00 | Added a feature to the visualisation, worked in the baseline document. |
| Birgit | 20:00 | 23:30 | Searching for bugs, wasn't able to entirely fix intersection count for finished outputs, updated notes on the datastructure. Changed random algoritm so if it fails to lay down a net, it removes it and tries again later. Removed methods from datastructure we didn't use. |
| Jade | 13:00 | 15:00 | Worked on A* algorithm. |
| Jade | 22:00 | 23:59 | Worked on A* algorithm. |

| Jade | 00:00 | 04:00 | Worked on A* algorithm.|
| Birgit | 10:00 | 13:00 | Trying to implement the intersection count in a different way, hoping it'll work better. Writing a new algorithm. |
| Birgit | 13:45 | | Fixing minor errors in the reading of datafiles in the grid object and the visualisation function. Perfecting new algorithm to work on bigger chips. |
